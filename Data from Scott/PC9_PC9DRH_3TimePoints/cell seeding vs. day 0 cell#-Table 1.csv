"PC9 cell seeding vs. CTG read conversion based on ""4/6/18's standarded curve of y = 0.0209x - 2304.1"" does not work   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"This (-4) is not a valid cell #.  Therefore, standarded curve has to be generated at every experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
It might be more reasonable to assume that the cell# at 24h after cell seeding is similar to the number seeded than to use stardard curve calculation unless do it every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
